           <ul>
                <li>I am a 4th year student at Carleton University Studying Interactive Multimedia Design.</li>
                <li>I love technology. Anything from VR/AR through to Quantum Computing. Advances in these spaces have potential for so many interesting and helpful applications. </li>
                <li>I really enjoy making things and putting a fun and or funny spin on it.</li>
                <li>I am a huge nerd. I like building computers and playing City Builders on them.</li>
                <li>I am also a huge advocate for AI and contextual based HCI.</li>

        <h2>A 'brief' history</h2>
        <img id="small-me" src="../images/little-me.JPG">
        <figcaption><i>My sister and I on the PC that totally doesn't age myself</i></figcaption>
        <p>I have always loved technology and computers <i>even when my oldest sister would only let me watch her use it</i>.
        </p>
        <p>From the age of 9 I had access to my own computer, and started making videos. Typically gaming oriented since I am a huge nerd. I'd upload these to YouTube and make my friends watch.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, I learned about my love of doing things differently. Making things fun. Everything and everyone seems to take themselves so seriously. Especially school assignments and projects. So whenever presented the oppurtunity, I made videos for my assignments in elementary and highschool.</p>
        <p>My goal was always to make something fun, and enjoyable, and most importantly different than everyone else. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iqTHcvMZSIExs63gtDntU8oJSoyoZCQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see some of these videos here</a>.</p>
        <p>Once I went to Carleton University's Media Production and Design (MPAD/BMPD) program, I started to learn a lot more about media in general. I took courses in Game Design, AR, Web Interface Development, writing, and programming. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://view.genially.com/64473b3c4ffe120018c38e18/interactive-content-the-missing-fountain">I even got to make a cool mystery game</a>.</p>
        <p>During the summer of my first year, through to the summer of my second, I worked at Canada Computers as a Sales Associate. I got to build computers for customers, talk about games all day, and see new and fancy parts. However, I left my position in 2023 to focus more on school.</p>
        <p>MPAD ended up not being a perfect fit for me. It focused more on the study of media and journalism than the creation of things. Which is great, and I learned a lot, took some great classes, and met some awesome people. But it didn't really align with where I saw myself in the future.</p>
        <p>I found that I really enjoyed making things, I really liked programming, and I enjoyed the creativity of it all. So, I ended up transfering out to my current program in 2023.</p>
        <p>That about catches us up to today. Right now I am trying my hand at full-stack web development to enhance some personal projects, and expand my skill set.</p>
