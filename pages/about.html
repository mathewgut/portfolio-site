                <li>I am a 4th year student at Carleton University Studying Interactive Multimedia Design.</li>
                <li>I love technology. Anything from VR/AR through to Quantum Computing. Advances in these spaces have potential for so many interesting and helpful applications. </li>
                <li>I really enjoy making things and putting a fun and or funny spin on it.</li>
                <li>I am a huge nerd. I like building computers and playing City Builders on them.</li>
                <li>I am also a huge advocate for AI and contextual based HCI.</li>

        <figcaption><i>My sister and I on the PC that totally doesn't age myself</i></figcaption>
        <p>I love technology. I always have. I think it's just so cool the endless possibilities of what we can create, simulate, and produce through some 1s and 0s.</p>
        <p>As a kid, of course I mainly used technology for gaming... and I still do. I loved watching YouTube videos, specifically ones of gaming. Montages, funny moments, commentaries, video essays, the whole lot. Then I thought, 'I could do that', and I did. All be it, not as well.</p>
        <p>From ages 9-18 I made videos, a lot of them. Somewhere in the realm of 200. I loved it. I learned how much I liked creating things, getting feedback, seeing the 'fruits of my labour' as it were. I loved being able to make something unique, and something that others would get a kick out of too. I especially loved making videos for school projects.</p>
        <p>I always found school projects boring. You get a guideline then you make something within the barriers of everyone else. Not creative, but worst of all, not fun. So whenever presented the oppurtunity, I made sure to make something that fits the guidlines, but is also goofy.</p>
        <p>I pushed the envelope a little... or a lot. Esepecially because 90% of the projects I made videos for, were in fact not supposed to be in video form. But I always got a good grade, and I always got a good laugh. </p>
        <p>Some of my video projects can be found here.</p>
        <p>Eventually it came time for University. I found Carleton because of their Media Production and Design program. An amazing program absolutely packed with industry professionals led by Dr. Vicky McArthur. </p>
        <p>In the two years I was in that program, I took courses in Web Interface Development and Python. Then I discovered how much fun programming is. Yes sometimes you want to pull your teeth straight out from your head. However, it's another avenue to make fun and or funny stuff.</p>
        <p>I started getting into programming, and more specifically, into AI Model Engineering. Since the release of ChatGPT I have been enthralled. The oppurtunites for creation have become bigger.</p>
        <p>With this new found inspiration for creating things, I made some really rudementry programs utilizing localized LLM's. </p>
