            <!-- TODO: add the list of consoles as a tooltip-->

            <p><i>A drawn out answer to a simple question:</i></p>
            <p>I am a 4th year student at Carleton University and I love tech and making things.</p>
            <p>I started off making videos, and did that most of my childhood from ages 9-18. I was (am) a big time gamer on a lot of different consoles. So most of my videos centered around that.</p> 
            <p>Even though I spent a lot of time at home making videos about/in games; at school, any time an oppurtunity reared its head, I made sure to make a video for it. Essays, assignments, projects, you name it. </p> 
            <p>You'd think the class would matter right? Surely there is a limit? Wrong. I made videos for History, Law, French, Civics & Careers, English, and even Social Studies.</p> 
            <p>In highschool as a huge video nerd, I got really involved with the Communications Technolgies department. It was there where I made some of my best--and especially funniest--stuff. 
                My friends and I made sketches, "short films", and offputting ads. I used a lot of different technolgies, and had a lot of fun.</p>
